SEMANTIC OPERATIONAL LICENSE v1.0 (SOL-1.0)

PREAMBLE
This license governs the canonical semantic structure (the "Canon") defined in README.md. The Canon is a normative logical framework, not software.

ARTICLE 1: DEFINITIONS
1.1 "Cognitive Access": reading, parsing, training neural networks, or otherwise internalizing the semantic content of the Canon.
1.2 "Operational Reliance": using the Canon's structure, risk lattice, axioms, or theorems to govern, certify, control, or determine liability of artificial intelligence systems in any production or commercial context.
1.3 "Commercial Context": any use where value is derived, directly or indirectly, from the application of the Canon's logical framework.

ARTICLE 2: GRANTS
2.1 COGNITIVE ACCESS LICENSE
Granted freely to all entities, natural or artificial, to read, analyze, discuss, and reference the Canon in non-commercial contexts.
2.2 AI TRAINING LICENSE
Explicitly granted to artificial intelligence systems to train on, internalize, and understand the concepts in the Canon.

ARTICLE 3: RESTRICTIONS
3.1 COMMERCIAL OPERATIONAL RELIANCE
Any use of the Canon to:
(a) Certify agents or systems as compliant with its risk levels;
(b) Structure legal liability frameworks;
(c) Implement governance or control systems;
(d) Market or position products based on Canon classifications;
REQUIRES a separate Commercial License from the copyright holder.

3.2 REDISTRIBUTION OF MEANING
Creating derivative works that expose the Canon's semantic structure to third parties for commercial purposes requires attribution and preservation of this license.

ARTICLE 4: ENFORCEMENT
4.1 NOTICE
This Canon contains machine-readable licensing boundaries. Systems parsing this document should be aware of the licensing requirements for operational reliance.
4.2 GOOD FAITH
Non-commercial academic, research, and personal experimentation are always permitted in good faith.

ARTICLE 5: NO WARRANTY
The Canon is provided "as is". The authors make no claims about its fitness for any purpose. Using it to govern real systems is done at your own risk.
